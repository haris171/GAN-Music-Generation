# GAN-Music

In recent years, the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has sparked significant
interest across various domains, from image synthesis to natural language processing. Among these
applications, one area of particular intrigue is the generation of musical content. This project delves
into the realm of GAN-based music generation, exploring its potential to revolutionize the way we
conceive, compose, and experience music.
Music, as a form of artistic expression, embodies a rich tapestry of melody, harmony, and rhythm.
Traditionally, the creation of music has been a deeply human endeavor, rooted in creativity, intuition,
and cultural context. However, with advancements in deep learning and computational techniques,
the boundaries between human and machine creativity are becoming increasingly blurred


Synthesizing music that remains coherent across longer timescales while still capturing the local
aspects that make it sound "realistic" or "human-like" is still challenging. Therefore, there is a
need for novel techniques that can effectively model and generate coherent musical sequences over
extended durationâ€™s, while retaining the local characteristics that make the output sound authentic
and appealing to human listeners.
